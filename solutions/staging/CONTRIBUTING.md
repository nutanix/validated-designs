# 2. Making Changes
## 2.1. General Contribution Guidance

Always create a new branch from validated-designs\master.
  - This repository uses [GitHub branch protection](https://help.github.com/en/github/administering-a-repository/about-protected-branches)
  - The purpose of creating a new branch is to develop pipeline/build changes or add new solutions, the goal of doing a GitHub pull request back into master branch.

Make as few changes as technically required.
  - Keeping PRs small and hermetic makes changes easier to review and lessens the potential regression blast radius.

Keep good documentation (be kind to your future self and fellow developers!)
  - Contribute to the README, CONTRIBUTING, and other documentation. Follow airport security rules: If you see something, say something.
  - Keep good a good CHANGELOG. It is a pain to dig through mountains of PRs to try to figure out why something was done.

Build locally before creating a PR.
  - Building locally ensures that you have confidence in your change before asking others to review it.
  - See "How do I build locally?" section for details.

Do functional testing before final PR merges.
  - See "Testing" section for details.

Document and/or address technical debt.
  - Contributions, even small, for cleanups and debt reduction are always welcome; however, we know that free time is always in short supply.
  - At minimum, if you see something that should be TODO'd in the future, please add in-line TODO comments where applicable.
  - For those just getting started, addressing even a small TODO item is a great way to learn and see the process in action.
